"""
Given n balloons, indexed from 0 to n-1. Each balloon is painted with a number on it represented by array nums.
You are asked to burst all the balloons.
If the you burst balloon i you will get nums[left] * nums[i] * nums[right] coins.
Here left and right are adjacent indices of i. After the burst, the left and right then becomes adjacent.

Find the maximum coins you can collect by bursting the balloons wisely.

Note:
(1) You may imagine nums[-1] = nums[n] = 1. They are not real therefore you can not burst them.
(2) 0 ≤ n ≤ 500, 0 ≤ nums[i] ≤ 100

Example:

Given [3, 1, 5, 8]

Return 167

    nums = [3,1,5,8] --> [3,5,8] -->   [3,8]   -->  [8]  --> []
   coins =  3*1*5      +  3*5*8    +  1*3*8      + 1*8*1   = 167

"""
1. Scan the given list and prepare a list of elements and their position. 
    Example (3,0) means element 3 at index 0
2. Sort the list based on the key=element at index[0] in the list.
3. Declare an output_coins variable which is used to store the result.
4. Start a loop which iterated until there are no elements in the given list.
    Pick the element from the sorted list which is minimum and is not at the edge.
     (because 1*min-element*neighbor is smaller).
    Index into the input list where you found this min element and 
        compute output_coins=output_coins+ (previous element * current element *next element)
        Delete the current item from the list.
5. Return the output_coins value.

1. Prepare a sliding window that contains 3 elements.
2. For each of those sliding window, compute the product of those elements and store it in a output variable.
3. Prepare a list without the middle element of the sliding window and the rest of the original list.
4. Repeat step 1 to 3 recursively and keep computing the product and keep adding it to the output variable.
