Given an array and a value, find if there is a triplet in array whose sum is equal to the given value.
If there is such a triplet present in array, then print the triplet and return true. Else return false.
For example, if the given array is {12, 3, 4, 1, 6, 9} and given sum is 24,
then there is a triplet (12, 3 and 9) present in array whose sum is 24.

Time complexity of the method 1 is O(n^3).
The complexity can be reduced to O(n^2) by sorting the array first, and then using method 1 of this post in a loop.
1) Sort the input array.
2) Fix the first element as A[i] where i is from 0 to array size â€“ 2.
After fixing the first element of triplet, find the other two elements using method 1 of this post.
