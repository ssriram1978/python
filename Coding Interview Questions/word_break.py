"""
Given a non-empty string s and a dictionary wordDict containing a list of non-empty words,
determine if s can be segmented into a space-separated sequence of one or more dictionary words.
You may assume the dictionary does not contain duplicate words.

For example, given
s = "leetcode",
dict = ["leet", "code"].

Return true because "leetcode" can be segmented as "leet code".

UPDATE (2017/1/4):
The wordDict parameter had been changed to a list of strings (instead of a set of strings).
Please reload the code definition to get the latest changes.
"""
"""
Algorithm:
----------
Add all wordDict to a dictionary.
Starting at index 0 search for a character or a bunch of characters in dictionary.
Keep accumulating characters and perform a lookup until you find a match.
Split the word right at the point you found a match.
Perform a lookup of the remaining word in the dictionary.
If you did not find the remaining word, then, repeat the steps 2 to 4 until you find a match.
Repeat this until you reach the end of the input string.
