"""
Given two words (beginWord and endWord), and a dictionary's word list,
find the length of shortest transformation sequence from beginWord to endWord, such that:

Only one letter can be changed at a time.
Each transformed word must exist in the word list. Note that beginWord is not a transformed word.
For example,

Given:
beginWord = "hit"
endWord = "cog"
wordList = ["hot","dot","dog","lot","log","cog"]
As one shortest transformation is "hit" -> "hot" -> "dot" -> "dog" -> "cog",
return its length 5.

Note:
Return 0 if there is no such transformation sequence.
All words have the same length.
All words contain only lowercase alphabetic characters.
You may assume no duplicates in the word list.
You may assume beginWord and endWord are non-empty and are not the same.
UPDATE (2017/1/20):
The wordList parameter had been changed to a list of strings (instead of a set of strings).
Please reload the code definition to get the latest changes.

"""
"""
Perform a DFS on the wordlist by searching the beginword with each word in the wordlist.
Enqueue the beginword into the wordlist and increment a counter by 1.
Start a while loop that iterates while the list is not empty:
    In this while loop, do the following.
    Dequeue the current_word from the queue.
    Peform a sweep of the dictionary of words to find a word in the dictionary that differ
    by one single character with the current_word.
        If you found a match, then, 
            Enqueue that word to the queue.
            Increment the match by 1
            Delete the word from the dictionary so that you don't reuse it again.
            If the word matches with the endword, then, break from the while loop and return the current match count.
        If you did not find a match, then,do nothing.
