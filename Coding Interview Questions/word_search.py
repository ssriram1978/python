"""
Given a 2D board and a word, find if the word exists in the grid.

The word can be constructed from letters of sequentially adjacent cell,
where "adjacent" cells are those horizontally or vertically neighboring.
The same letter cell may not be used more than once.

For example,
Given board =

[
  ['A','B','C','E'],
  ['S','F','C','S'],
  ['A','D','E','E']
]
word = "ABCCED", -> returns true,
word = "SEE", -> returns true,
word = "ABCB", -> returns false.

Iterative algorithm:
This is the way to go because
1. For every search, backtracking is needed because every path and every combination need to be
analyzed for a possible match.
Example: string "abc" matched successfully but the next character did not match. In this case,
We need to find the last character in the neighborhood of the previous character and continue the search.
In this example, we need to find "c" in the neighborhood of "b" and continue the search.
This falls under Depth first search algorithm where the algorithm tries to invoke recursively until it finds
a match deep into the tree and then search for neighbors surrounding the parent node until it reaches the root.


Non iterative algorithm:

It is fully not ready because backtracking needs to be accounted for.

For every character in board, perform the following:
    Peform a linear search for the occurance of the first character in the board:
        If you find the first character, mark the location of the character (x,y)
                where x is the index of the row.
                where y is the index of the column.
            Store these indexes in a board_dict where the character is the key.

Declare is_match_found to be False
Declare character_index to be 0
Declare previous_character list to be []
While is_match_found==False or character_index reached the end of the character, do the following:
    Find the list of character occurances from the board_dict.
        If this is the first character then, 
            Store the first character in word_list with the list of occurances.
        Else:
            Declare a boolean flag current_character_match and set it to False 
            For every occurance of the character (a,b) from the list:
                Iterate over every occurance of the last character(x,y) from word_list:
                Check if one of the following condition match occurs:
                    1. right match x,y+1 == a,b
                    2. down match x+1,y == a,b
                    3. left match x,y-1 == a,b
                    4. up match, x-1,y == a,b
                    If one of these above said conditions match,
                        set current_character_match to True.
                        Append this current_character match to the word_list.
                        Continue the search and if you find one more match append this to the word_list
            if current_character_match is True:
                store the current character index as previous_character index
                if you already reached the end of the word, then set the is_match_found to True
            else:
                Go back to the previous character and search for the next character in the neighborhood
                of the previous character.
                This requires backtracking and a flag that denotes whether the previous character list is searched 
                fully or not.
