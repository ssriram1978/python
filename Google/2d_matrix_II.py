"""
Write an efficient algorithm that searches for a value in an m x n matrix. This matrix has the following properties:

Integers in each row are sorted in ascending from left to right.
Integers in each column are sorted in ascending from top to bottom.
For example,

Consider the following matrix:

[
  [1,   4,  7, 11, 15],
  [2,   5,  8, 12, 19],
  [3,   6,  9, 16, 22],
  [10, 13, 14, 17, 24],
  [18, 21, 23, 26, 30]
]
Given target = 5, return true.

Given target = 20, return false.

1) Start with top right element
2) Loop: compare this element e with x
….i) if they are equal then return its position
…ii) e < x then move it to down (if out of bound of matrix then break return false) ..iii) e > x then move it to left (if out of bound of matrix then break return false)
3) repeat the i), ii) and iii) till you find element or returned false
