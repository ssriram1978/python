#Given an unsorted array of integers, find the length of the longest consecutive elements sequence.
#For example,
#Given [100, 4, 200, 1, 3, 2],
#The longest consecutive elements sequence is [1, 2, 3, 4]. Return its length: 4.
#Your algorithm should run in O(n) complexity.

"""
1. Add each element to a hash table. o(n)
2. For each element x in the list, o(n)
   check if x is already there in the output list and skip the element if it is already there.
   check if x-1 or x+1 is there in the hash table.
     If x-1 or x+1 is not there in the hash table, then, go to the next element in the list.
     If x-1 is there in the hash table:
       append x and x-1 to the output list
       keep searching for x=x-1 and keep appending it to output list until you do not find a match.
     If x+1 is there in the hash table:
       append x and x-1 to the output list
       keep searching for x=x+1 and keep appending it to the output list until you do not find a match.

    Walk over the output_list and find the largest sub list that contains all elements and return this list.
