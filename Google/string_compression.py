#1.6 String compression
#Implement a method to perform basic string compression using the counts of repeated characters.
# For example, the string aabccccaaa would become a2b1c4a3.
#If the compressed string would not become smaller than the original string,
#your method should return the original string.
#You can assume the string has only uppercase and lowercase letters (a-z).

def compress_string(string_val):
    #initialize the compressed string to empty
    compressed_string=""
    #define a variable that will be used as an index into the original string.
    index=0
    #start a while loop to iterate over each and every character in the original string.
    while(index < len(string_val)):
        #fetch the character from the original string at the desired location.
        character=string_val[index]
        #append the character to the compressed string.
        compressed_string+=character
        #Define a count variable to count the number of times the character is repeated in the original string.
        count=0
        #start a while loop to keep incrementing the index and count as long as
        # current index is less than the length of the string
        #character at current index is equal to the character at the next index.
        while(index < len(string_val) and
            character == string_val[index]):
            index+=1
            count+=1
        #append the final count to the compressed string.
        compressed_string +=str(count)

    if len(compressed_string) < len(string_val):
        return compressed_string
    else:
        return string_val

print(compress_string("abca"))
