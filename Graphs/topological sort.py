Topological Sorting
Topological sorting for Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) is a linear ordering
of vertices such that for every directed edge uv, vertex u comes before v in the ordering.
Topological Sorting for a graph is not possible if the graph is not a DAG.

 In topological sorting, we use a temporary stack.
 We donâ€™t print the vertex immediately, we first recursively call topological sorting
 for all its adjacent vertices, then push it to a stack.
 Finally, print contents of stack. Note that a vertex is pushed to stack only when
 all of its adjacent vertices (and their adjacent vertices and so on) are already in stack.


 Find the ordering of tasks from given dependencies:
 ---------------------------------------------------
There are a total of n tasks you have to pick, labeled from 0 to n-1.
Some tasks may have prerequisites tasks,
for example to pick task 0 you have to first finish tasks 1, which is expressed as a pair: [0, 1]

Given the total number of tasks and a list of prerequisite pairs,
return the ordering of tasks you should pick to finish all tasks.

There may be multiple correct orders, you just need to return one of them.
If it is impossible to finish all tasks, return an empty array.

Input: 2, [[1, 0]]
Output: [0, 1]
Explanation: There are a total of 2 tasks to pick.
To pick task 1 you should have finished task 0. So the correct task order is [0, 1] .


Input: 4, [[1, 0], [2, 0], [3, 1], [3, 2]]
Output: [0, 1, 2, 3] or [0, 2, 1, 3]
Explanation: There are a total of 4 tasks to pick.
To pick task 3 you should have finished both tasks 1 and 2.
Both tasks 1 and 2 should be pick after you finished task 0.
So one correct task order is [0, 1, 2, 3].
Another correct ordering is [0, 2, 1, 3].
