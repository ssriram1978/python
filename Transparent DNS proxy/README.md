Functionality:

dnsserver_10_136_5_60.py

This is a Transparent DNS Transparent Proxy server.
It acts as a middle man and intercepts the DNS request from the client and takes corresponding action.
It uses scapy module to be installed.
It reads a file whitelist_blacklist2.txt to know the domains that are Blacklisted.
It sniffs out packets coming on its host interface and if the packets are DNS request packets (dest port 53), it parses the DNS packet and checks if the domain is blacklisted. 
If the Domain is Blacklisted, then, the script sends a DNS reject response.
If the Domain is whitelisted, then, the scripts allows the DNS request to be forwarded to the original destination.

whitelist_blacklist.py:

This acts as a helper tool to do the following:
Read a file whitelist_blacklist.txt to know the domains that are blacklisted.
It resolves the urlâ€™s to valid IP address using DNSpy module.
It gets those IP addresses and feeds it to another application (HAPROXY) via socat command.
